# Academic-Collaboration-Network-Analysis
Comprehensive analysis of academic collaboration networks within the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) conference publications for the years 2020-2022

This project explored how researchers and institutions collaborate across geographical and organizational boundaries, providing insights into the structure of academic research communities in computational linguistics.

## Data Collection & Processing
Source: ACL conference papers
Extraction Method: Used LLAMA to extract structured information from papers
Data Points:

Paper codes
Author names
Author countries
Author institutions
Institution types (academic vs. non-academic)
Author continents


Data Cleaning: Standardized institution names, resolved affiliation ambiguities, and normalized location data

## Methodology

Two distinct network analysis approaches to capture different dimensions of collaboration:

1. Organization-Wise Analysis

This approach measured the strength of collaboration between universities by counting all possible affiliation pairings within papers.

2. Paper-Wise Analysis

This approach identified the existence of collaborative relationships between universities in each paper.
